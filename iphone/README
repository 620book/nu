This directory contains a Nukefile for building the iPhone version of Nu.

The Nukefile builds Nu as a static library (libNu.a) that can be linked
into an iPhone application.  When linking this library into your application,
be sure that the -ObjC link flag is specified; otherwise, most of the classes 
in libNu.a will not be linked into your application.

Your application should #include "Nu/Nu.h", which is copied into the include
directory as part of the build process.

Currently only the iPhone simulator is supported. Support for the iPhone itself
requires an ARM port of libffi.  A port is available from Anthony Green
(http://sourceware.org/libffi/), but has not yet been verified on the iPhone.
